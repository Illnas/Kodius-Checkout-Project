Kodius Checkout Project

Simple project: make a checkout system in React.js.

First time I finished this project it had some problems with responsiveness and
with some calculations. For example, I should not have removed ability for user
to earn money through transactions; user was supposed to go into negative in his 
cart.

After fixing those mistakes, HR I was talking with was replaced with someone
who had old repo. I did make new repo but I send that link to the lady I was
originally talking.

I got rejected for a job offer at Kodius.

Does not matter, I learned few things, had fun making this project and will continue to improve even more.

For this project I used: React-Router, uuid, react-date-picker.

I need to fix old projects that I was doing at Algebra, then I will start with 
Final Assignment that is required to graduate from Algebra.
